### Miscellaneous code from my Computer Science Courses

#### Disclaimer:
##### If you're a current CS student (especially at UPR-RP) please don't copy/paste this code and just change the variable names. 
##### Please use this code only if you're really stuck and looking for some implementations to find a solution or use it and reimplement/improve my code to the point where you understand the solution and how you get there. 
##### You're doing yourself a disservice if you're not learning (understanding and improving not just passing) from your assignments. If you're passing your assignments by copy/pasting, it'll bite you back in the ass in the future :)
##### Final note. For now, I'm not providing any instructions or dependencies to run this code and not all of it is implemented 100% correctly

This is a repo where I'll be storing any code which I found challenging and interesting to complete, and/or I thought was of at least passable quality.
Languages covered will include sml_nj, C, python (some uploaded as a jupyter notebook), C++. 
I don't have all of my code from my courses, but I'll try to keep this up to date.
