###Miscellaneous code from my Computer Science Courses

####Disclaimer:
#####If you're a current CS student (especially at UPR-RP) please don't copy/paste this code and just change the variable names. 
#####Please use this code only if you're really stuck and looking for some implementations to find a solution or use it and reimplement/improve my code to the point where you understand the solution and how you get there. 
#####You're doing yourself a disservice if you're not learning (understanding and improving not just passing) from your assignments and you're passing your assignments by copy/pasting. It'll bite you back in the ass in the future :)
#####Final note. For now, I'm not providing any instructions or dependencies to run this code and not all of it is implemented 100% correctly

This is a repo where I'll be storing any code which I found challenging to complete, and/or I thought was of at least passable quality.
Languages covered will include sml_nj, C, python, C++. 
I don't have all of my code since I lost my old laptop's backup, but I'll try to keep this up to date to prevent a similar situation.
